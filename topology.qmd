# Topology

## What is topology?

Topology is the study of topological spaces. This is not enough to close this chapter.

A topological space can be thought of as a set with little "scales" called *open sets*. Each of these open sets represent the notion of *continuity* or *connectivity* that we sense when we look at an object: the feeling that it is just "one single piece of a thing", like the scales in a fish.

More formally,

::: {#def-def}
A topological space is a pair $(X, \tau)$ where

- $X$ is a set;

- $\tau$ is a set of subsets of $X$, that is: each $U \in \tau$ is a set $U \subseteq X$.

The set $\tau$ has the following properties:

- the intersection of a finite number of open sets is also an open set;

- the union of an arbitrary (even infinity) number of open sets is also an open set;

- the $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open sets.

An example that should be always brought to the mind is the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers, with open sets given by the open intervals $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ (and its unions).

When an open set $U$ cannot be written as the disjoint union of two open sets, we say that $U$ is *connected*. These connected open sets give a notion of "being a single piece".

## The notion of "sameness" in topology

:::{#def-def}
Given two topological spaces $(X, \tau)$ and $(Y, \sigma)$, a function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be *continuous* if the inverse image of any open set of $Y$ is also an open set of $X$. In symbols:

$$
\forall \; V \in \sigma, \; f^{-1}(V) \in \tau
$$

Topology only looks to open sets
