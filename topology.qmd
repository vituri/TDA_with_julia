# Topology

> "[...] mathematics stands above everything. The works of Abel and Kronecker are as good today as they were four hundred years ago, and it will always be so. New roads arise, but the old ones lead on. They do not become overgrown. There... there you have eternity. Only mathematics does not fear it. Up there, I understood how final it is. And strong. There was nothing like it. And the fact that I had to struggle was also good. I slaved away at it, and when I couldn't sleep I would go over, in my mind, the material I had studied that day." \

In this chapter we will define topological spaces and some of its properties, the notion of homeomorphism and so on.

## What is topology?

Topology is the study of topological spaces and its properties. Unfortunately, this is not enough to close this chapter.

A topological space can be thought of as a set with little "scales" called *open sets*. Each of these open sets represent the notion of local *continuity* or *connectivity* that we sense when we look at an object: the feeling that it is just "one single piece of a thing", like the scales in a fish. We can stretch these scales (but don't rip them apart). In a sense, topological spaces are elastic. Because of that, there is an old joke that a topologist can't distinguish between a cup and a donut.

More formally,

::: {#def-def}
A topological space is a pair $(X, \tau)$ where

- $X$ is a set;

- $\tau$ is a set of subsets of $X$, that is: each $U \in \tau$ is a set $U \subseteq X$.

The set $\tau$ has the following properties:

- the intersection of a finite number of open sets is also an open set;

- the union of an arbitrary (even infinity) number of open sets is also an open set;

- the $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open sets.

The set $\tau$ is called a *topology* on $X$.
:::

We often omit the $\tau$ and simply write "a topological space $X$". Sometimes we omit the "topological" too. We love omiting!

The set of all subsets of $X$ is denoted by $P(X)$, because it consists of all "Parts" of $X$.

Given a set $X$, there is a easy way to generate a topology on $X$: consider any $S \subseteq P(X)$. Then define $\tau$ by taking finite intersections and arbitrary unions of elements of $S$. This topology is called "generated by $S$". In this case, $S$ is called a generator set for $\tau$.

An example that should be always brought to the mind is the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers, with open sets generated by the open intervals $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

When an open set $U$ cannot be written as the disjoint union of two open sets, we say that $U$ is *connected*. These connected open sets give a notion of "being a single piece".

## The notion of "sameness" in topology

Let's digress a little.

A topological space is completely define by a set $X$ and its open sets $\tau$. If we just "rename" the elements of $X$, then it is intuitive that this new topological space is as similar to $X$ as possible; in fact, they are indistinguishable from each other. Every property that the first has, the second also has.

Renaming points is just a informally way to say "bijection of sets". So, two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are "the same thing, topologically speaking" if there is a bijection $f: X \to Y$ such that $U \subseteq X$ is open if and only if $f(X) \subseteq Y$ is open. Let's formalize the concept of functions that behave nicely with respect to open sets.

:::{#def-def}
Given two topological spaces $(X, \tau)$ and $(Y, \sigma)$, a function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be *continuous* if the inverse image of any open set of $Y$ is also an open set of $X$. In symbols:

$$
\forall \; V \in \sigma, \; f^{-1}(V) \in \tau.
$$

:::

We can think of continuous functions (or simply *maps*) as a way to deform $X$ into $Y$ without ripping $X$ apart.
